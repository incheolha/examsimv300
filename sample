      The TOEFL iBT test measures your ability to use and understand the English language as it is read, heard, spoken,
and written in the university classroom. As the most accepted English-language test in the world, more than 7,500
universities, agencies, and other institutions in more than 130 countries accept TOEFL scores as part of their
admissions criteria.
In order for the TOEFL iBT test to measure how well you read, listen, speak, and write in English, and how well you
use these skills together, you will be asked to integrate these skills. For example, you may read a passage or listen
to a lecture, and then write or speak about what you learned.
